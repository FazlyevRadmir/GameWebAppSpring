        </div>
        <p class="answer">What I saw on Maincast was downright fierce shit. That's real, no offense to them. These are the people I grew up with, in fact, and whom I admired as professionals in this business. The same v1lat and there are a lot of people there. But what I saw, I immediately turned off. For two seconds I want to watch, and then the desire disappears. Even no personal rejection of certain people. Just not interested. That's just weak. You see that people do everything automatically.
